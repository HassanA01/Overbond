# Overbond Coding Assessment

Language used: Python
Frameworks/Libraries Used: Numpy, Matplotlib, xlrd

The reasoning behind using Python is because of all the powerful libraries it provides for data aggregation and parsing data. 

Through the course of this assessment I incorporated Numpy, Matplotlib and xlrd for the very first time hence I ran into numerous bugs but in the end, the desired result came out after testing with the sample input.

Since it was my first time working with these libraries, I am confident enough to say if provided with additional time to complete this assessment, I would have been able to develop a better solution. However, I believe my solution is efficient and does the extracts the required data and plots it on a scatterplot successfully without crashing.

The code is documented with simple outlines of what each block of code is performing for viewers to understand my thought process. I tested my application manually by creating and filling out a datasheet similar to the sample input and getting the correct output. If provided more time, I would be able to further solidify code by creating automated testing.

# Executing the app
To execute the app and get the desired data, simply just put your datasheet in the same working directory as the python file. Please make sure to name your datasheet "Book1.xls" and provide the data on "Sheet1" of your excel book. Once again, if provided more time, I would allow the program to assess multiple sheets in a excel book.


Hope you enjoy my solution and I look forward to hearing for the next stage :)
